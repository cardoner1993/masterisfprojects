High entropy can be an indicator of potential malicious behavior, as malware authors often employ techniques to conceal their code and evade detection.
CreateRemoteThread is often exploited for process injection. 
Unsigned executables from unknown publishers should be treated as suspicious. 
.data and .bss are typically safe, but should still be verified. 
Behavioral sign: Creates autorun registry keys.
High entropy often indicates packed or encrypted files, being a sign of malware. 
CreateRemoteThread is often exploited for process injection. 
Digitally signed files are more likely to be benign. .rsrc can contain embedded malicious payloads. Behavioral sign: Disables Windows Defender or modifies Group Policy.
Entropy can be misleading; context and other features matter. 
WriteProcessMemory is a red flag if used without proper context. Unsigned executables from unknown publishers should be treated as suspicious. .data and .bss are typically safe, but should still be verified. Behavioral sign: Uses packers like UPX or ASPack.
Low entropy suggests the file is likely unpacked and benign. 
Usage of VirtualAlloc is typical in malware for memory allocation. Digitally signed files are more likely to be benign. .text section is executable and often targeted by malware. Behavioral sign: Spawns child processes of legitimate executables (e.g., svchost).
High entropy often indicates packed or encrypted files. 
WriteProcessMemory is a red flag if used without proper context. Unsigned executables from unknown publishers should be treated as suspicious. .rsrc can contain embedded malicious payloads. Behavioral sign: Communicates with unknown IP addresses or domains.
Entropy can be misleading; context and other features matter. 
Benign applications rarely call low-level NTAPI functions. Digitally signed files are more likely to be benign. .data and .bss are typically safe, but should still be verified. Behavioral sign: Disables Windows Defender or modifies Group Policy.

File with moderate entry point offset. High entropy often indicates packed or encrypted files. Usage of VirtualAlloc is typical in malware for memory allocation. Unsigned executables from unknown publishers should be treated as suspicious. .data and .bss are typically safe, but should still be verified. Behavioral sign: Communicates with unknown IP addresses or domains.
